<h1>Developer Express Example<br />How to obtain labels from a datasource and handle deleted labels</h1>
<p>This example elaborates the approach illustrated in example http://www.devexpress.com/scid=E2028. Labels for appointments are obtained from a data source. When deleting, the label is not actually removed but its color and caption are changed to identify a "deleted label" entity which should be treated specifically. An appointment labeled with the "deleted label" could not be created or edited (moved, resized).
Additionally, this example demonstrates how to hide "deleted" labels when editing or creating a new appointment, as well as hide them in the appointment context menu.
This approach can help you to implement more complex scenario.</p>
